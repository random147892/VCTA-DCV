# Questions
1. What is ESXi and vCenter Server?
2. What are the vSphere componenets?
3. What ports are used in vSphere communication? 

# Evidence
## ESXi and vCenter Server
1. ESXi is the hypervisor on which create & run VMs
    1. aka VMkernel
2. vCenter Server is a service to centrally administer ESXi hosts that are connected on a network.

## vSphere Components
1. vSphere Client
    1. GUI for administering vCenter Server.
2. vCenter Server
    1. Software component that manages ESXi hosts and their resources.
    2. Deployed as virtual appliance on ESXi.
    3. virtual provisioning X daemon == vpxd is the main process of vCenter Server
        1. vpxd used to manage multiple ESXi hosts.
        2. vCenter Server installs a vpxa agent on each ESXi it manages.    
3. VM
    1. Software representation of physical computer and components.
4. ESXi
    1. Software running on host.
    2. Creates & runs VMs
    3. ESXi control underlying resources of server.
    4. One ESXi can be managed as standalone.
    5. Multiple ESXi managed through vCenter Server.
5. vSphere Network
    1. VMs connect to vSwitches.
    2. vSphere network connects VMs to physical network.
6. Storage Devices
    1. Types:
        1. Storage devices that are connected through network
        2. Storage devices that are directly attached to ESXi hosts.

## vSphere Communication Ports
1. vSphere Client with vCenter Server
    1. TCP 443
2. vCenter Server Management Interface with vCenter Server
    1. TCP 5480
3. vpxd with vpxa
    1. TCP/UDP 902
4. VMware Host Client with ESXi hosts
    1. TCP/UDP 902
