# Questions
1. What types of hypervisors exist?
2. How does a hypervisor transform physical hardware into virtual?
3. How does resource sharing works?

# Evidence
## Hypervisors

| Bare-Metal Hypervisor                 | Hosted Hypervisors                |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Type 1 Hypervisor                     | Type 2 Hypervisor                 |
| Directly installed on server hardware | Install on top of a OS            |
| VMware ESXi can host 1000+ VMs        | VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion |

### Installing ESXi
1. Media device containing software installed is mounted to host.
2. Connect a display and keyboard to host to access ESXi console.
3. Manage ESXi installation process from console.

### Transforming Physical Resources into Virtual
1. Hypervisor starts, takes over resources.
2. Create VMs on ESXi host. Allocating the required resources to host the guest OS.
3. Hypervisor creates virtual hardware for VM.
4. Hypervisor manages the virtual hardware assigned to VM.
5. Guest OS is installed on VM.

## Sharing Physical Resources
### Virtual CPU
1. ESXi host manages how much compute is available for each VM.
2. When guest OS request CPU, ESXi finds the available resources and makes it visible to the VM.
3. VMs can demand CPU simultaneously.
4. If the requested CPU is more than what is available the ESXi schedules the VMs to share CPU.

### Virtual Memory
1. Sum of configured memory sizes of all VMs can exceed the hosts memory. 
2. Memory resource settings for a VM determine the allocation.
3. Virtual memory size determines the available memory to appliactions that run in the VM.

### Virtual Networking
1. VMs share access to the same virtual switch and physical NICs on host.

### Virtual Disks
1. Multiple ESXi host can RW shared storage simultaneously.

### Virtual GPU
