# Questions
1. What types of virtualization exist?
2. Describe components of SDDC.

# Evidence

## Types of Virtualization
1. Server Virtualization
2. Network Virtualization
3. Storage Virtualization
4. Desktop Virtualization

### Server Virtualization
1. Each virtual machine runs it's own operating system.
2. Each VM can access the underlying computing resources of the physical server.
3. vSphere is the server virtualization solution at VMware.
   1. vSphere abstracts the physical resources of a host computer and makes them available to multiple guest VMs.

### Network Virtualization
1. Presents logical networking devices and services to connected VMs.
2. VMware Solution: NSX Data Center.
   1. Networking and security in one software application abstracted from the underlying physical infrastructure.

### Storage Virtualization
1. Solution: vSAN
   1. Storage virtualization at the host level and logically abstracts the physical storage layer for VMs

### Desktop Virtualization
1. Solutions: VMware Horizon
   1. Management and delivery of virtual desktops and apps through a single cloud platform to end users.

## Components of SDDC
1. Service Management and Automation
    1. Portfolio Management
    2. Operations Management
2. Cloud Management Layer
    1. Service Catalog
    2. Self-Service Portal
    3. Orchestration
3. Virtual Infrastructure Layer
    1. Hypervisor
    2. Pools of Resources
    3. Virtualization Control
4. Physical Layer
    1. Compute
    2. Storage
    3. Network
5. Business Continuity
    1. Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery
    2. Back Up and Restore
    3. Replication
6. Security
    1. Governance
    2. Risk
    3. Compliance

### Service Management and Automation
1. Keeping and managing the records of the service consumption.
2. Analyzing the data of events and trends.
3. Monitoring applications for availability and performance.
4. Alerting about system problems.

### Cloud Management Layer
1. Top layer of the stack.
   1. the consumption of cloud services occurs at this layer.
2. Commond cloud services
   1. access to the virtualized compute, network, storage resources.
   2. subscriptions to software applications.
3. Cloud manager configures
   1. a set of privileges
   2. pricing
   3. terms
   4. conditions
4. This layer calls for resources and orchestrates the actions of the lower layers.

### Virtual Infrastructure Layer
1. Absctracts the compute, networkings and storage resources from the physical layer.
2. This layer presents the virtualized resources to the cloud management layer.
3. This layer establishes a virtualized environment that integrates with the solutions in all other layers of the SDDC.

### Physical Layer
1. Lowest layer of SDDC.
2. Consists of compute, network, storage.
3. VMware Compatibility Guide shows supported hardware.
4. Infrastructure administrator organizes and manages the hardware by establishing a set of rules about how the resources function.

### Business Continuity
1. Layer includes solutions for data protection and disaster recovery of critical management componenets of SDDC.
2. If system component fails, redundant components take over.
3. If disaster occurs, the backup components in a remote location are used to resume operation.

#### Security
1. Secure design for all systems.

## Cloud Computing
1. Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services.

## Delivery method and management of cloud services
1. Private cloud
2. Public cloud
3. Hybrid cloud

## VMware Cloud Foundation
1. Integrates:
   1. vSphere
   2. NSX DC
   3. vSAN
2. Provides unified SDDC platform for public/private cloud.. Layer controls the operations that make an SDDC resilient to threats.
