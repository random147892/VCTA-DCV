# Questions
1. Describe a traditional server.
2. What is a virtual machine?
3. What are the components of a VM?
4. Describe the 4 main benefits of using VMs. 

# Evidence
## Traditional Server
1. Server is a computer that offers services to other computers == clients that are connected over the network.
2. Servers uses special CPU, RAM, etc.  that are more powerful than desktop computers.
3. OS running on the servers are not fully utilize the server resources.
    1. Resulting in inefficient use of resources.

## Virtual Machine
1. VM is a software representation of a physical computer.
2. VMs runs an OS and 1+ applications.
    1. VM's OS is called a guest OS.
3. Several VMs can run on a physical server.

### Components of VM
1. Application
    1. Application performs a task using resources.
2. OS
    1. Multiple guest OS run on a single physical server sharing its resources.
3. Drivers
    1. Software component that links the hardware to the OS in order to communicate with each other.
    2. VMware Tools is a bundle of drivers to aid guest OS & guest hardware communication.
4. Hardware
    1. Virtualization software abstracts physical hardware and present it as virtualized resources to VMs.
    2. Guest OS uses the virtualized hardware but it is unaware that hardware is virtualized.

### Benefits of VM
1. Isolation
    1. Adress problem of failure.
    2. If guest OS fails the other VMs are not affected.
2. Encapsulation
    1. Address problem of portability.
    2. Files that make up a VM are stored together in the same folder.
        1. Save the entire state of a VM to files that are encapsulated together.
        2. Copy the VM files to create multiple replicas.
        3. Move VM from one host to another. 
3. Hardware Independence
    1. Address problem of compatibility.
    2. Move any VM to any server.
4. Server Consolidation
    1. Address problem of costs.
    2. One server is utilized to its full potential without needing to buy another.
    3. Reduced power, cooling, maintenance cost
